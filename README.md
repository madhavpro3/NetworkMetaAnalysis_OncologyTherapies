# NetworkMetaAnalysis_OncologyTherapies
A network meta-analysis of immunotherapies and chemotherapy

A meta-analysis is used to summarize the results of comparing therapies from different studies that compare them head-to-head. A network meta-analysis compares multiple therapies from different studies with the advantage that with the formed network its possible to estimate indirect effects i.e compare therapies that were not compared head-to-head previously

The objective of this analysis is to compare effects of different immunotherapies and chemotherapy. The scope of the analysis is shown below

Clinical trials until 2017 are considered and further filtering led to selecting 11 trials with 7 therapies (6 immunotherapies and chemotherapy) with over 5000 patients. 2 Clinical metrics of efficacy Objective Response Rate (ORR) and Progression Free Survival at 6mon (PFS6mon) and High grade Adverse events are chosen for comparing the therapies.

Resulting network of therapies for these 3 metrics is shown below

The selected clinical studies are evaluated on Risk of bias as per the PRISMA guidelines

SUCRA scores (Surface area Under Cumulative RAnk curve) are calculated to rank the effectiveness of therapies
